Periodic Table in C
This is a simple implementation of the Periodic Table using C.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the program, you'll need a C compiler. You can use any compiler you like, but we recommend using GCC.

How to Use
The program allows you to view the properties of the elements in the periodic table. You can use the arrow keys to navigate the table, and press enter to select an element. Once you select an element, the program will display its properties, such as atomic number, symbol, and name.
